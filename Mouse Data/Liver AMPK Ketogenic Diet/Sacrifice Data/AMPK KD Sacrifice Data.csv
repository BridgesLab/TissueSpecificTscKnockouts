Both mice were switched. Both males were in female cage and both females were in male cage. Earlier that morning the mice were MRIed so I beleive the mice were only switched for about 4 hours.The cages had opposite food so the mice were exposed to the other diet for at least a few hours before sacrifice. THe MRI data on the mouse database were consistant with previous weights indicating the mice were probably only switched that morning. This means they were exposed to opposite food for about 4 hours.
