abstract = {The mammary gland consists of cells with gene expression patterns reflecting their cellular origins, function, and spatiotemporal context. However, knowledge of developmental kinetics and mechanisms of lineage specification is lacking. We address this significant knowledge gap by generating a single-cell transcriptome atlas encompassing embryonic, postnatal, and adult mouse mammary development. From these data, we map the chronology of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cell states and distinguish fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSCs) from their precursors and progeny. fMaSCs show balanced co-expression of factors associated with discrete adult lineages and a metabolic gene signature that subsides during maturation but reemerges in some human breast cancers and metastases. These data provide a useful resource for illuminating mammary cell heterogeneity, the kinetics of differentiation, and developmental correlates of tumorigenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of developing mouse mammary epithelia reveals the timing of lineage specification. Giraddi et al. find that fetal mammary stem cells co-express factors that define distinct lineages in their progeny and bear functionally relevant metabolic program signatures that change with differentiation and are resurrected in human breast cancers and metastases.},

abstract = {Cells in human milk are an untapped source, as potential “liquid breast biopsies”, of material for investigating lactation physiology in a non-invasive manner. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and their transcriptional signatures in women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes (GDM) with normal lactation. Methodology is described for coordinating milk collections with single cell capture and library preparation via cryopreservation, in addition to scRNA-seq data processing and analyses of MEC transcriptional signatures. We comprehensively characterized 3740 cells from milk samples from two mothers at two weeks postpartum. Most cells ({\textgreater}90{\%}) were luminal MECs (luMECs) expressing lactalbumin alpha and casein beta and positive for keratin 8 and keratin 18. Few cells were keratin 14+ basal MECs and a small immune cell population was present ({\textless}10{\%}). Analysis of differential gene expression among clusters identified six potentially distinct luMEC subpopulation signatures, suggesting the potential for subtle functional differences among luMECs, and included one cluster that was positive for both progenitor markers and mature milk transcripts. No expression of pluripotency markers POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1, encoding OCT4) SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) or nanog homeobox (NANOG), was observed. These observations were supported by flow cytometric analysis of MECs from mature milk samples from three women with diet-controlled GDM (2–8 mo postpartum), indicating a negligible basal/stem cell population (epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)−/integrin subunit alpha 6 (CD49f)+, 0.07{\%}) and a small progenitor population (EPCAM+/CD49f+, 1.1{\%}). We provide a computational framework for others and future studies, as well as report the first milk-derived cells to be analyzed by scRNA-seq. We discuss the clinical potential and current limitations of using milk-derived cells as material for characterizing human mammary physiology.},

@article{Bach2017,
abstract = {Characterising the hierarchy of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and how they are regulated during adult development is important for understanding how breast cancer arises. Here we report the use of single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of MECs across four developmental stages; nulliparous, mid gestation, lactation and post involution. Our analysis of 23,184 cells identifies 15 clusters, few of which could be fully characterised by a single marker gene. We argue instead that the epithelial cells - especially in the luminal compartment - should rather be conceptualised as being part of a continuous spectrum of differentiation. Furthermore, our data support the existence of a common luminal progenitor cell giving rise to intermediate, restricted alveolar and hormone-sensing progenitors. This luminal progenitor compartment undergoes transcriptional changes in response to a full pregnancy, lactation and involution. In summary, our results provide a global, unbiased view of adult mammary gland development.},

abstract = {Technological improvements enable single-cell epigenetic analyses of organ development. We reasoned that high-resolution single-cell chromatin accessibility mapping would provide needed insight into the epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional regulators involved in normal mammary gland development. Here, we provide a single-cell resource of chromatin accessibility for murine mammary development from the peak of fetal mammary stem cell (fMaSC) functional activity in late embryogenesis to the differentiation of adult basal and luminal cells. We find that the chromatin landscape within individual cells predicts both gene accessibility and transcription factor activity. The ability of single-cell chromatin profiling to separate E18 fetal mammary cells into clusters exhibiting basal-like and luminal-like chromatin features is noteworthy. Such distinctions were not evident in analyses of droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data. We present a web application as a scientific resource for facilitating future analyses of the gene regulatory networks involved in mammary development.},

abstract = {Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution. Video Abstract},
