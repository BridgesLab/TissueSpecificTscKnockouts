Figure and Table Key
====================

This document indicates where the raw data for each table and figure panel can be found, and which script was used to generate the data.  Figures were typically made using Rmarkdown files and modified if needed in Adobe Illustrator.  The figures listed below are the raw figure, finalized figures are in the combined illustrator file in this folder.  Tables are generally output from R scripts.
