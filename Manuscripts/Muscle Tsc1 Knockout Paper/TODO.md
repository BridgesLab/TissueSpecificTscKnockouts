## General Comments About Article

ARS: Very interesting study, but I think there are a lot of things missing that the reviewers will ding you on no matter where you send the paper.  I mentioned a few of these in the text.  I didn’t really do a serious rewrite of the paper since I think these missing experiments really need attention.  I think the biggest question is why there is such a big decrease in fat mass, with such a small effect on energy expenditure.  I get that there is a lot of muscle, but still…..  There are lots of missing things- same measurements in ND and HFD, incomplete reporting on metabolic cage studies, serum levels of insulin, glucose, ffas, leptin, cytokines, etc. It just needs a lot more.  I don’t think AJP is taking papers like this that aren’t really complete.  Also what about insulin sensitivity in muscle?  I think you also need measurements of fat and glucose oxidation- not that hard to do.  Sorry to sound so negative.  I think reviewers will be much harsher.

QT: I think Figure 4 and the text related to this figure need a bit of work.
