I no longer have access to illustrator
Look at *Need to do* for experiments that still need to be run
Food intake data looks a little weird, how do I fix that?
Get cartoon mouse, liver muscle, blood from dave for figure 1
Ask JeAnna for western Blot data from computer
Rate of drop ITT. 
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
ps6 and ps6k are the same on the blots. Need to cut out. 
get new AMPK antibody for the females - western blot
Look at *Need to do* experiemnt list 
do we need to redo 
Ask jeanna to look at Licorr and blots
if there is a change in fatty liver, you can get more lipogenesis (synthesis) and or more delivery to the liver (lipolysis) (transport), less beta-oxidation, or less bile acid production and eflux (if you have more TGs you usually have more cholesterol)
measure denovo lipogenesis in vivo (give mice radio active water- direct biochemical measurement in the liver) - expensive 
what is the activity of various enzymes - ACC example - more ACC acitivty - could measure in vivo by providing some substrate upstream of ACC - could provide acetate - then measure how much of end product is formed in vivo (malonyl coa) - boardest way is the water experiment 
couild take lysates and give them radioactive acetyl CoA and ask how much radio active malonyl CoA there is - enzymes still work - rate of production is the ACC activity - hard to do bc you need an HBLC to seperate the acetyl CO a and Malonyl CoA - next best thing to in vivo 
look at protein levels - if there is more protien these is more activity - if we just look at levels may not correleate with lipogenesis - - less pACC, more ACC, more lipogenesis - only one of those 4 things - not all four things 
pACC, ACC, FAS, ACYL will get closer to answering the lipogenesis question 
cholesterol stuff - export is regulated by sip7a1 - regulated transcriptionally by Fox something - qPCR questoin - looking at mRNA and looking at how much you have - can look at other lipogenic genes as well - down regulated by ketongeic diet previously, do they come back up in the KO? qPCR for these genes as well
beta-oxidation - gold standard and provide radioactive lipid - inject VLDL encased lipid - olaic acid converted to CO2 and measure CO2 production - doable but not what we are gonna do - next best is in cells - See Horse - can give cells fatty acids and ask the oxygen production - looking in the liver - would hypothesis the effect is in the liver - next best thing is looking at proteins - when you do beta-oxidation it is in the mitochondria - is there more mitochodnria - is there more mitochodnria? - can use the trizol from the RNA preps that have the mitochondria DNA - use PCR to count the DNA - how many copies per cell of mitochdonria - that prep is different - someone else may do it - mitochondiral quality - need to do electon microscopy which we don't have - have to send in samples - could western blot of beta-oxidation - usually look at electron transport chain enzymes (complex 1-5, have one antibody for that) - for actual beta-oxidation genes they do qPCR - 15 different enzymes and chose a few - will probably look at beta-oxidation through qPCR
before we do TG assays we should do western blotting question done - most of the female lysates that we have and rerun those - start by rerunning females we already have using the new antibody - compare to ACC - rerun males as well  - qPCR using liver samples using RNA preps - then go to TG assays - if the females are KO, then run more females for ketones but that is low priority - other thing we want to think about is looking at insulin levels (maybe GDF15)- insulin levels would help - we have fasting glucose levels but not insulin - insulin eliza 

Run SDS pages, transfer them for 4-5 hours or overnight and run qPCR plates during the same day - takes about 2 hours to set up and 2 hours to run PCR - could set up multiple plates per day - can also make more RNA preps for males and save the trizols for the mitochondira analysis - come in in 2 consecutive days
