Ask Dave how to correctly put in file path in README file? 
Ask Dave how I should save my Figure 1 (made in illustrator) bc it is through VMware horrizon Client not my personal computer.
Put Figure 1 in README file.
Do I put "figure 1" on the figure in illustrator?
Ask Dave if Figure 1 looks ok.
How do I insert Figure 1 from illustrator into the manuscript? Do I need to do that?
Currently, the Ketone-body-analysis.rmd file includes Raptor data. How do I generate just AMPK data without deleting the Raptor stuff? Should I make a new R file that includes only AMPK so that I don't mess up the current R file? 
Once I generate the ketone figure using R I drag the PDF I want to use into illustrator. 
Then I take the script and data for the script and put that in the repository in github (do i need to change the file path in the R script when I move the data?)
Next, I record the file path in the README file. 
In the R code, I see "theme(text = element_text(size=18))" to increase the font size. However, I don't know how to make the labels 11, the axis 8 and the panel 18. I did everything 11.
