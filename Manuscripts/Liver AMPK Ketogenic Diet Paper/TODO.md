Ask Dave if how I am saving illustrator files is ok. Mention that illustrator will not save my figures if they are not on the computer.
Do I put "figure 1" on the figure in illustrator?
Ask if I can use pictures from the internet on figure 1 or if I have to draw them.
Do I need to insert figure 1 illustrator into the manuscript. How do you do that?
In the R code, I see "theme(text = element_text(size=18))" to increase the font size. However, I don't know how to make the labels 11, the axis 8 and the panel 18. I did everything 11. 
Figure 3 and Figures 4 A-C dissappear on the illustrator file after I sign out of the VM ware. I should add those figures onto illustrator at the very end all at the same time. 
Need to make new Western Blot figures. Should I include female data for western blots? Only the males? Manuscript vs presentation?
Should I include change in body weight or raw body weight data?
For the manuscript, should I include sac data?
How do I get the western blot data from off the computer?
Interpretation of ITT?
Mark what we have and don't have for females. Ketone bodies? Cut livers? 
Rate of drop ITT. 
add in sac data for manuscript - lean MRI, muscle mass, fat MRI, fat mass
add in the why you did little experiments and results. 
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
ps6 and ps6k are the same on the blots. Need to cut out.
