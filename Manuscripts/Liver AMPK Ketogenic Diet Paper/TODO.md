I no longer have access to illustrator
Look at *Need to do* for experiments that still need to be run
Food intake data looks a little weird, how do I fix that?
Get cartoon mouse, liver muscle, blood from dave for figure 1
Rate of drop ITT. 
I tried to update the number of mice in each group for ITT, ketone assay, food intake and sac data but it is still showing 10 or 11 mice for Male, keto cre and I don't know why. In total, the mice that need be excluded are (8830,8831,8715-19,8786, all cre but not ko, survived to the end) (8346, 8825, 8826, 8785, 8787, 8558,all cre, all died early so did not blot livers). exclude cages 7895,7882,7890 from food intake. These were the cages affected by the not ko. All the mice in these cages were not ko. 
how do you write up liver histology section?
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
ps6 and ps6k are the same on the blots. Need to cut out. 
get new AMPK antibody for the females - western blot
Ask jeanna to look at Licorr and blots
rerun females liver lysates we already have using new AMPK antibody - compare to ACC 
rerun males as well using new AMPK antibody
check the males listed as "not KO" and compare to the new blots
Make sure you have blots for pACC, ACC, FAS, ACLY (lipogenic genes) for all mice
Need to do qPCR for cholesterol genes, beta-oxidation genes, mitochondria from trizol in RNA preps
TGs assay
if the females are KO, then run more females for ketones but that is low priority 
look at insulin levels (maybe GDF15)- insulin levels would help - we have fasting glucose levels but not insulin - insulin eliza 
Need to get ACLY and pAMPK protein quantification data off computer
fix blot script to include most up to date blots
make protein lysates of female KO livers, then run the ones that SHOULD be KO based on injections with male timing
run pAMPK and pACC for the AJ mice from previous experiemnt 
get black and white ACC and ACLY image
need to make lysates for female AMPK and then do blots for females
need Mito complexes and pACLY for AMPK mice
maybe redo pAMPK for AMPK mice?
For AJ mice need new total AMPK, pAMPK, ACC, pACC
Look at fat mass for 8345 and 8344 for week 4 MRI (we do not have that data on the graphs, are they on the database? on the computer?) week 3 was done on 2019-07-16 so week 4 should be 1 week after that.
Need to cut some female GFP control livers for lysates
