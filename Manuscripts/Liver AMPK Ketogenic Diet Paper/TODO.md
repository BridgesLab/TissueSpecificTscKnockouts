Look at *Need to do* for experiments that still need to be run
Food intake data looks a little weird, needs to be fixed. exclude cages 7895,7882,7890 from food intake.These were the cages affected by the not ko. All the mice in these cages were not ko. 
Get cartoon mouse, liver muscle, blood from dave for figure 1
Rate of drop ITT. 
the mice that need be excluded are (8830,8831,8715-19,8786, all cre but not ko, survived to the end) (8346, 8825, 8826, 8785, 8787, 8558,all cre, all died early so did not blot livers). 
how do you write up liver histology section?
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
The S6 band is very faint compared to the pS6 band. Both appear in the same spot on the blot but S6 is very faint. 
Make liver lysates for AMPK females, then do western blots to test for AMPK, pAMPK, ACC, pACC. run the ones that SHOULD be KO based on injections with male timing
rerun females liver lysates we already have using new AMPK antibody - compare to ACC 
Need to do qPCR for cholesterol genes, beta-oxidation genes, mitochondria from trizol in RNA preps
TGs assay
if the females are KO, then run more females for ketones but that is low priority 
look at insulin levels (maybe GDF15)- insulin levels would help - we have fasting glucose levels but not insulin - insulin eliza 
run blots for the AJ mice from previous keto experiemnt. For AJ mice need new total AMPK, pAMPK, ACC, pACC
need Mito complexes and pACLY for AMPK mice
maybe redo pAMPK for AMPK mice
according to script we did not have week 4 fat mass for 8344 and 8345. However, the dates were actually off on the script. script says week 3 is 7/16 but Both were sacced on date 7/16/20. 7/16 was actually their week 4 but the script thinks that is their week3 which is why there is no week 4 data point for those two mice in the fat mass data. 8344 and 45 had two -2 weeks. Week of 6/11 needed to be listed as week -1 not -2 and the following weeks needed to be bumped up by 1 week. I manually changed the following weeks for the 8344 and 5. I updated the scripts and the graphs look a little strange. Ask dave if I did this right.
8344 is missing week 3 lean mass data. check computer for this data.
When you get into lab tomorrow: scan blots, do primary/secondary antibodies for other blots, check pACC, ACC and FAS quantification on licor, make lysates for all newly cut female livers -> CRE Control (8476, 8477, 8564, 8565, 8566) -> CRE Keto (8713, 8714, 8720) -> GFP Control (8347, 8832, 8833, 8834) -> GFP Keto (8827, 8828, 8829). For lysates (check there are enough stainless steel beads, cool centrifuge to 4C, calculate RIPA buffer needed, check notes for all the buffers needed, get ice for tissues, make sure to label enough clean tubes, check if i cut 8827,28,29 and mark on sheet if I did)
Update the NEW blot sheet with females that I have already run. Run the four missing CRE female mice and the 3/4 CRE keto mice again. **for the extra female livers, if all other males have already been cut then it is probably those two missing female livers**
