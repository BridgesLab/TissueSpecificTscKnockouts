I no longer have access to illustrator
Look at *Need to do* for experiments that still need to be run
Food intake data looks a little weird, how do I fix that?
Get cartoon mouse, liver muscle, blood from dave for figure 1
Rate of drop ITT. 
I tried to update the number of mice in each group for ITT, it is still showing 11 mice for Male, keto cre and I don't know why.
how do you write up liver histology section?
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
ps6 and ps6k are the same on the blots. Need to cut out. 
get new AMPK antibody for the females - western blot
Ask jeanna to look at Licorr and blots
rerun females liver lysates we already have using new AMPK antibody - compare to ACC 
rerun males as well using new AMPK antibody
check the males listed as "not KO" and compare to the new blots
Make sure you have blots for pACC, ACC, FAS, ACLY (lipogenic genes) for all mice
Need to do qPCR for cholesterol genes, beta-oxidation genes, mitochondria from trizol in RNA preps
TGs assay
if the females are KO, then run more females for ketones but that is low priority 
look at insulin levels (maybe GDF15)- insulin levels would help - we have fasting glucose levels but not insulin - insulin eliza
