Look at *Need to do* for experiments that still need to be run
Food intake data looks a little weird, needs to be fixed. exclude cages 7895,7882,7890 from food intake.These were the cages affected by the not ko. All the mice in these cages were not ko. 
Get cartoon mouse, liver muscle, blood from dave for figure 1
Rate of drop ITT. 
the mice that need be excluded are (8830,8831,8715-19,8786, all cre but not ko, survived to the end) (8346, 8825, 8826, 8785, 8787, 8558,all cre, all died early so did not blot livers). 
how do you write up liver histology section?
In figure legends indicate n, MRI, experiement method
Need to look at beta-oxidation genes for western blotting (CPT1, MCAD and ACAD)
Need to look at sip7a1 on western blot. Others have suggested there is a decrease in sip7a1 on ketogenic diets (this regulates bile acid reuptake and may explain increase in cholesterol on ketogenic diets)
The S6 band is very faint compared to the pS6 band. Both appear in the same spot on the blot but S6 is very faint. 
Make liver lysates for AMPK females, then do western blots to test for AMPK, pAMPK, ACC, pACC. run the ones that SHOULD be KO based on injections with male timing
rerun females liver lysates we already have using new AMPK antibody - compare to ACC 
Need to do qPCR for cholesterol genes, beta-oxidation genes, mitochondria from trizol in RNA preps
TGs assay
if the females are KO, then run more females for ketones but that is low priority 
look at insulin levels (maybe GDF15)- insulin levels would help - we have fasting glucose levels but not insulin - insulin eliza 
Fix blot script, not running
run blots for the AJ mice from previous keto experiemnt. For AJ mice need new total AMPK, pAMPK, ACC, pACC
need Mito complexes and pACLY for AMPK mice
maybe redo pAMPK for AMPK mice
Look at fat mass for 8345 and 8344 for week 4 MRI (we do not have that data on the graphs, are they on the database? on the computer?) week 3 was done on 2019-07-16 so week 4 should be 1 week after that.
8344 and 8345 were sacced on date 7/16/20. 7/16 was actually their week 4 but the script thinks that is their week3 which is why there is no week 4 data point for those two mice in the fat mass data. Something is off about them in the script.
