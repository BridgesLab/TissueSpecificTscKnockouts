Ask Dave if how I am saving illustrator files is ok. Mention that illustrator will not save my figures if they are not on the computer.
Do I put "figure 1" on the figure in illustrator?
Ask if I can use pictures from the internet on figure 1 or if I have to draw them.
Do I need to insert figure 1 illustrator into the manuscript. How do you do that?
In the R code, I see "theme(text = element_text(size=18))" to increase the font size. However, I don't know how to make the labels 11, the axis 8 and the panel 18. I did everything 11. 
Figure 3 and Figures 4 A-C dissappear on the illustrator file after I sign out of the VM ware. I should add those figures onto illustrator at the very end all at the same time. 
Need to make new Western Blot figures. Should I include female data for western blots? Only the males? Manuscript vs presentation?

How do I get the western blot data from off the computer?
interpretation of FAS, ps6, ps6k?
level of detail of methods for lysates, western blot
Interpretation of ITT?
What do I do with figures?
