# Purpose

To aggregate GSEA results and make a finalized table for publication

# Raw Data

Text files generated by the script RNAseq/scripts/MakeGSEATable.py.  Each file contains pathway name, size, NES, nominal an FDR p-values as well as the Gene Details which contains the leading edge for that pathway.  This includes every pathway that met FDR <0.25/  This script was most recently run on Mon Mar  4 12:16:22 2019.



The input files can be found in /Users/davebrid/Documents/GitHub/TissueSpecificTscKnockouts/RNAseq/data/processed/gsea_results.  The input files were:

- biocarta_summary.txt
- cgp_summary.txt
- go_bp_summary.txt
- go_cc_summary.txt
- go_mf_summary.txt
- kegg_summary.txt
- mirna_summary.txt
- reactome_summary.txt
- tft_summary.txt

There were 674 pathways with enrichment at an FDR of 0.25.  These data are written out to the file Summary of GSEA Results.csv.
